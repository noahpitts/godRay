## GPU Acceleration of Volumetric Rendering | Isak Karlsson | Noah Pitts

## Summary
For our First Milestone we were primarily focused on transitioning over to the Nvidia OptiX ray tracing platform. This required setting up our environment in Windows with Visual Studio and leaning the necessary CUDA and OptiX programs. We set up a basic iterative pathtracing program with which we can build the volume rendering algorithms into.

## Milestones
### GPU Pathtracer Skeleton in OptiX
The pathtraching program in Optix was primarily built from referance sample programs. No single sample program contained the full set of features neccessary to build off of. However between a set 4 or 5 key samples we were able to piece together the neccessary functions to have a program that is similar in capabilities to project 3 in the course.


### Emission/Absorbtion Model and Single Scattering Model


### Whats Next and Review of Schedule
The next two weeks of the project we will be primarily focused on implementing the volumetric rendering portion of our project. Now that we have our basic application in place here is the order in which we plan to implement the rest of the project:

## ACM Template
We downloaded and began to look at the ACM template for formatting of the final report (see link below). Most of the report is still from the template but will be updated as we continue to move forward.
